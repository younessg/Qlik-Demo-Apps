Some of the issues I faced while working with Qlik Sense 3.1.1 and the connector

* There is a Bug in the Twitter REST connector UI, can demonstrate that during the interview.
* Issue in the JS API, you can't get a variable value but rather the string representation of the var!
* Named tables maybe loaded without a name at times! Probably due to upgrading from 3.0.2 to 3.1.1.
* Not possible to pass selected values to a master item of variable type.
* You can export to csv but when imported it is messy!
* You can export to a qdv but you can't load the same qvd!
* You can't undo deleting a master item var.
* None used vars can't be cleaned out.
* Selecting a field for the purpose of inserting it into a GUI object dimension at times didn't work.
